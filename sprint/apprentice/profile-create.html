                <br>
                <br>The Chief Executive of Skills Funding is registered with the Information
                Commissioner responsible for the Data Protection and Freedom of
                Information Acts. Our notification can be viewed on the Information
                Commissioners website at http://www.ico.gov.uk/
                <br>
                <br>You have certain rights over the things you tell us about yourself
                when using ‘the system’. These rights are given to you under the
                Data Protection Act 1998.
                <br>
                <br>Personal information from visitors to ‘the system’ is only collected
                if it is volunteered to us.
                <br>
                <br>‘The system’ is not intended to attract children under the age

                <br>
                <br>2. Use of personal information

                <br>‘The system’ enables individuals to apply for apprenticeships and

                to sift and shortlist candidates for interview that meet the criteria

                <br>

                you
                <br>

                searches and identify by proxy, potential areas of demand by the
                Chief Executive of Skills Funding. It will not be passed onto any
                third party.
                <br>
                <br>d) Research and Partner information
                <br>

                employees and agents, in supporting the registered candidate in
                the searching and application process managed through ‘the system’.
                Partner Organisations include Connexions, JCP, organisations delivering

                <br>Personal information relating to users or administrators of ‘the
                system’ may be used for administration and research purposes.
                <br>
                <br>e) Additional Uses
                <br>
                <br>The personal information obtained from ‘the system’ (including
                registration) may be used by the Chief Executive of Skills Funding
                or by any successors thereof for the purposes described above.
                <br>
                <br>f) Duration of candidate data held and deleting your account
                <br>
                <br>‘The system’ will check for inactive accounts as part of its housekeeping
                and system performance. Candidates who have completed the registration
                process but have not logged onto ‘the system’ for 12 months following
                registration will be deleted. In addition Candidates who have commenced
                the registration process but have not activated their registration
                within 30 days of their activation email will also be deleted.
                In both cases the candidates personal details will be removed,
                and they will be required to re-register to use ‘the system’.
                <br>
                <br>Candidates also have the ability to remove their details from ‘the
                system’ in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 by deleting
                their account through their My Profile menu or by contacting the
                National Helpdesk at nationalhelpdesk@apprenticeships.gov.uk. This
                will remove all personal details and the account will be deleted.
                To continue to use ‘the system’ the candidate will need to re-register.
                <br>
                <br>g) Improper use of ‘the system’ and data held within it
                <br>
                <br>The Chief Executive of Skills Funding reserves the right to delete
                Candidate accounts that make use of inappropriate personal information
                including email addresses and usernames.
                <br>
                <br>The Chief Executive of Skills Funding shall pass on to third parties
                personal information relating to members of ‘the system’, including
                candidates, learning providers, employers or personal information
                obtained from ‘the system’ for the purpose of investigating any
                illegal or improper use or behaviour. The Chief Executive of Skills
                Funding will also disclose your personal information if required
                to do so by law in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety,
                the public or ‘the system’.
                <br>
                <br>3. Security
                <br>
                <br>The Chief Executive of Skills Funding will use reasonable effort
                to ensure that all personal information relating to ‘the system’
                is secure against unauthorised access.
                <br>
                <br>Where the Chief Executive of Skills Funding needs to send the information
                to third parties for the purpose of providing a service to registered
                candidates, we will only provide those third parties the information
                they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from
                using that information for any other purpose.
                <br>
